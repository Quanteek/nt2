Performances
^^^^^^^^^^^^

I have a SIMD enabled processor but |nt2| performance are bad
-------------------------------------------------------------

I have a multi-core processor but |nt2| performance are bad
-----------------------------------------------------------

Does |nt2| support `some obscure intrinsic` ?
---------------------------------------------

General Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Is |nt2| compatible with `some third-party data structure` ?
------------------------------------------------------------

We can't realistically be compatible with the Universe. |nt2| is designed to
be compatible with sensible elements of day-to-day C++ corum and to provide
extension mechanisms to become compatible with anything else. If your multi-precision
integer of choice or your octonion class is not supported, feel free to contribute
by building the needed extension for |nt2|.
